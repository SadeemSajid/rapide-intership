## Getting Started

### Setup venv

```

Then, activate it:

source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, finally install the packages from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you're done working, deactivate the environment:

### Directories

Work is in their separate directories categorised by weeks. Week 1, for example, has different codes.

Each task is categorised by its separate file.

Some servers might need their datasets, look at the ipynb files for more details.
